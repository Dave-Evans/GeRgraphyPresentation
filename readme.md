## GeRgraphy: : an Introduction to Spatial Data Manipulation and Analysis in R
by Dave Evans and Aaron Ruesch

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) are useful for storing, manipulating, and analyzing spatial data, but most GIS users interact with their data using graphical user interfaces (i.e., GUIs), which are limited in their ability to automate data processing tasks, facilitate tabular data manipulation, and import user-contributed statistical libraries. A number of packages have been developed in the R framework that fill this void. We will discuss spatial data types and their structures, along with discussions and examples of data input/output, modeling, munging, and plotting/mapping of spatial data in R.
