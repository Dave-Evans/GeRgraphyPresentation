GIS stands for Geographic Information Systems, and is the term used for the dicipline and practice of incorporating, storing, manipulating, maintaining, analyzing, and displaying spatial data. GIS can be conceptualized as a suite of tools for working with spatial data. Spatial data are data that are referenced to a location, that is the data have coordinates that pin it down to a location on the Earth. Examples are so myriad as to almost not be useful, e.g. restaurant location, streets, geologic strata, and precipitation, but they all have in common numeric values that reference the location of the data in X and Y (or longitude and latitude). EXPLANATION OF X AND Y.
